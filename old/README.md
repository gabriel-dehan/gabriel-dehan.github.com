# Gabriel Dehan

Ohoy ! So, the name is Gabriel, I am a _Web student_ @cifacom, in Paris, France, and also, mainly, [CoHoop](http://www.cohoop.com) Co-founder and Lead developer.
I am passionate about Ruby, Rails, Node.js, Meteor.js, computer internals, programming languages internals, and I see design pattern everywhere.
I love Design Pattern studies, it is this like running on this never ending road, full of discoveries and cool pubs. I like pubs, too.
