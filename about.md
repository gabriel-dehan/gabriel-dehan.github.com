# Gabriel Dehan

<img src="/assets/img/content/about_illustration.png" css=/>

Ohoy ! So, the name is **Gabriel**, and I am a _Web student_ @cifacom, in **Paris**, France.<br />
I am passionate about _Ruby, Rails, Meteor.js, computer internals, programming languages internals_, and I see design pattern everywhere.<br />

I love to study Design Patterns. It is this like running on this never ending road, full of discoveries and cool pubs. I like pubs, too.<br />

You can follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/gabrieldehan) or on gith... well, that's a nonsense.<br />
