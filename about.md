# Gabriel Dehan

Ohoy ! So, the name is **Gabriel**, I am a _Web student_ @cifacom, in **Paris**, France, and also, mainly, [CoHoop](http://www.cohoop.com) Co-founder and Lead developer.< br/>

I am passionate about _Ruby, Rails, Node.js, Meteor.js, computer internals, programming languages internals_, and I see design pattern everywhere.<br />
I love Design Pattern studies, it is this like running on this never ending road, full of discoveries and cool pubs. I like pubs, too.<br />

You can follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/gabrieldehan) and github.<br />
