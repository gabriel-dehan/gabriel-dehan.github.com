This is not my story. This is yours. The story of how you joined this University. It will be moving, I can assure you, lot of tears. Every line.

# Chapter - 0 : When you met cucumber-cat

It was an accident. Really, I swear. A real accident. I mean, car crashing, firetrucks down, blood, screams, the whole thing. A real mess.<br />
You were quite alive. I think, it was a long time ago. You were stuck between two cars, tough; convinced that you were going to die here, forgotten behind the curtain of smoke.<br />
Some time passed. It might have been hours, or seconds, how could you know ? You should have bought this watch. I told you.<br/>
Well, anyway, time had passed when you heard the sound of helicopters getting closer. The smoke started to clear up. And he was there. On top of the yellow taxi. Right there.

Carried away by his delirium, he was laughing. A raving, demented laugh, reverberating throughout the night.<br />
It was beautiful.<br />
He looked down on you. You, feeble little thing. So flimsy, so weak. He lifted up one of the cars that were crushing you. Like this, easily, as if weighted nothing more than a cow. A cow !<br />
It was beautiful. He jumped to the ground, licked his wound for a few minutes, and then into your dizzy arms, licking yours.<br />
Since this day, he has always been with you, through sick and health. He is the most faithful friend you ever had. And let's be honest : he looks delicious.<br />

# Chapter - 1 : Temptation

It was one of those cold winter Mondays. You were at the market, picking apples to bake in your cucumber-cat salad. That promised to be a yummy meal, when suddenly you overheard a conversation between Mr. Frank and his wife. They were arguing about a new University that had opened its doors recently. It sounded awesome.<br />
In a rush, you turned around, and got back home, to pack.<br />
Yes, like that. Your sweet cucumber-cat salad will have to wait. You just hope they won't get too sad while you're away. They could even expire, without proper care.<br />
Here you are : way too excited. You've always dreamed of joining the student body of an University. But you were always way too busy with this project of yours. You can't really remember it, but it had something to do with Tuna feathers and pillows. An awesome idea, really. A shame nobody could understand its beauty.<br />
Anyway. In a large 5 minutes, you are ready to go. Maybe the cat will learn to feed himself yogurt, but you have to go.<br /><br />

Seriously, this new University of theirs, it's free of charge. And you like free of charge, it has its ring. And it's open to everyone, they say. You can learn anything, they say.
In a little less than twelve days monocycle riding, you're there. Well, here, now. You get it.<br />

# Chapter - 2 : Registration

It's there : magnificent, monumental. Not like those paper model of the White House your little nephew used to make when he was six. Ah, politics. Always.<br />

You take a closer look from the entrance. The sun shines on the tremendous garden, full of prodigious lilies and gigantic weeping willows, laying their pendulous branchlets on a wiggly-woobly pathway leading to a colossal entrance, its two beautifully carved wooden-panel resting wide open, letting the sun sweep the few last shadows away.<br /><br />

"I have only been here for a few seconds and I am already smarter !" - You think, congratulating yourself for those last few observations.<br /><br />

You breath. Now that you think of it, it looks much like a cathedral. A bit more up-to-date, maybe. There is some weird giant RJ45 cable hanging from something that looks a lot like an arrow slit.<br />
Well, you mean, it's made of a lot glass, of course. So much for the intimacy, by the way.<br /><br />

"But it still looks like an arrow slit." - You think aloud, walking along the pathway.<br /><br />

Maybe you should have brought a gift ?<br />
But you are now in front of the entrance. It's a bit intimidating, I know. Now, come on. Step inside. It's only carved wood on those panels, I can assure you.<br /><br />

God, there is a lot of people, here. You turn your head around, and notice that even as you hardly had put your foot in, there was something running toward you. Maybe it is a cucumber-cat, sent here to great you ?<br />
Sadly, you finally notice that it is only a human.<br />
But still : he runs fast.<br />
The entry hall must be a fifty or sixty yard long. The floor is all carpeted, it seems soft. And the sun smoothes it all. You have a sudden urge to lie there.<br /><br />

- "Sir ? Sir ?<br />
- One minute, please ! This cozy blue carpet is begging me !<br />
- Sir, you need to be registered to lie down.<br />
- I see. Take me to your leader.<br />
- Sir ? You just need to fill in a few forms."<br />

He sits you down, and gives you a pen. It sure feels like school, now. And you sure as hell want a reward sticker. Quickly, you grab the pen and start filling it with your own informations, pouring gibberishy-data on the paper. Honestly, it's indecipherable. You could have been a Doctor. You got what it takes, that is.<br /><br />

There is not an awful lot of questions, it mainly wants to know more about your interests and fields of knowledge. It doesn't even asks you how you are doing. Self-centered little piece of paper.<br /><br />

"- I hope you'll rot in hell, compressed piece of moist cellulose's fibers." - And you mean it.<br /><br />

Look, it's spreading. This place is flooding with your intellect.<br /><br />

Once done, you hand back the forms, dripping with wet ink.<br /><br />

You are now officially a student. You don't feel much like lying on the carpet now. You want to discover it all.<br />
There is a massive board over there. At the other end of the hallway. This might be a good place to start, there is a lot of people writing on it, reading it. You start walking, getting ready to go closer, when you are suddenly shout out at.<br />
It's an old acquaintance of yours. What is he doing here ?<br />
He seems to be here to guide you. He is talking about receiving a notification, sharing the same interests, he has been sent for you. 
You don't get it. Maybe he is a dopplÃ«ganger ? a flimsy angel, here to cover you with his tender arms ?<br /><br />

He is telling you all about the registration form you filled in, and how they looked for students you might have known and might get along with.<br /><br />

Whilst  slowly moving towards the great board, he introduces you to a lot of old friends.<br /><br />

"- Is this some sort of a "Friends Reunited" reunion ?" - You ask<br />
"- Not at all, but it is important to build up a community and create friendships, you will always do your best with people you like and who shares your interests.<br />
- But isn't it like being social ? I don't like that ! I want my cucumber-cat !<br />
- Don't worry, he sent us a note, all will be fine."<br /><br />

All of a sudden, he stops, rummage his left pocket and take out one of those technological-touch-thingy, before giving it to you.<br /><br />

"- You will need it." - He says, before vanishing all the sudden, leaving only a slight trail of sulfury smell and a maniacal laugh behind.<br /><br />

# Chapter - 3 : Informations

Where has he gone ? Maybe he is in a better place. This thing happens, you know. Don't worry.<br />
Now, take a look at this new device of yours. Like this, slide this thing.<br />
You execute yourself and emit a little gasp of wonder. The technological-touch-thingy  (TTY, from now on) now displays an elegant number, written in the most finest lettering you've ever seen.<br />
You drop it, shivering with fear.<br /><br />

"I AM NOT A NUMBER" - You start yelling.<br />
"I AM A FREE MAN !"<br />

Everybody is watching you, now. You quickly pick up the undamaged TTY and unsteadily touch it again. There is a screen, with messages everywhere. And a contact list of some sort. Hey ! Here are all the people you've met just a few minutes ago !<br /><br />

"Handy !" - You think.<br /><br />

You starts to play with it, giving it a poke. Trying it on for size. Finally you decide that it might not be as evil as you thought. You put it in your pocket and starts walking towards the huge board, once again. And eventually, you get in front of it.<br />
It really is huge. Like a giant marshmallow building, only flatter, and less sweet. You're not sure you are supposed to lick it, and you won't.<br />

"It is serious business, I am a student, now."<br /><br />

As you look around, and read a bit, you find that this board is full of messages. Other students needs help. And there he is ! Cucumber-cat.<br />
And there are new messages every second ! And boy those are interesting ones, it's like they know what you're in. Do you think that the Thought Police is near by ?<br /><br />

"Quick, stop thinking about licking this board !"<br /><br />

In a matter of seconds, you calm your effervescent mind and notice that you can add your own message, through your own TTY.<br />
Everybody is doing it, sharing, helping. It's crazy in here !<br />

# Chapter - 4 : Toward a better salad.

Look ! There is even a collaborative class in cooking. Starts in 20 minutes they say. You could learn how to perfectly roast your cucumber-cat. Go for it. Move.<br /><br />

Because of all this new excitement, you didn't realize that you have no idea where to go. You start panicking, but a little voice comes out of your pocket : your TTY does. Just relax.<br />
It knows what you want, and it will guide you on way towards a better salad. It's like a tiny assistant. But not as cute. The advantage is that you won't smother it by putting it in your pocket. And it doesn't have to pee every hour.<br />
Wait a minute. Can it really talk ?<br /><br />

"That's creepy ! It's a screen, and it talks.<br />
What kind of black magic is that ? Can I talk to it ? Will it answer ? Will it ask me how I am doing ? He might be kinder than a piece of paper." - You start thinking.<br /><br />

You get it out of your pocket, and sit down on a step of this stair you were walking up. As you start to discuss with it, you begin to enjoy it and have a nice little chat about the philosophical implications of the disparities found in multiple states of consciousness. But sadly, you are running late and you put it back in your pocket.<br /><br />

"It is really a nice thing, maybe I should give it a name. Gregory ? Wait. Is it a girl ? Or a guy ?"<br />
"I think it's a guy."<br /><br />

"Mr. Freckle"

# Chapter - 5 : I miss cucumber-cat

But he hisses you too, don't worry.<br />
Do you think he will rot ? Meowing helplessly ?<br />

# Chapter - 6 : Time to pitch in

You finally make it to the front of your classroom.<br />
A sign on the door reads : "Don't hurt the door."<br /><br />

"That's considerate" - You think.<br /><br />

You are not willing to hurt this poor door and ask her politely :<br />
"Could you open, please ? Mrs. Door ?"<br /><br />

Nothing. Not even a whistle in the dark.<br />
She has left you no choice : you have to knock.<br /><br />

"Sorry, little door."<br /><br /><br />

As you start knocking, the door starts whining, but suddenly opens.<br />
There is not much people there. Maybe 5 or 6. You enter quietly, gently pushing the door, patting the door.<br /><br />

Nobody notices you. They are all arguing, writing stuff, yelling, whispering. And they have really long hair.<br /><br />

"Hippies." - You think, contemptuously.<br /><br />

But as you are getting closer, you notice that those were not hair. Not at all. They are all linked to some sort of giant horizontal technological-touchy-board. Those are very thin cables. All links. You want to caress one, it might be as soft as a cucumber-cat's skin.<br />
You wished.<br />
