# Gabriel Dehan

Ohoy ! So, the name is Gabriel, and I am a _Web student_ @cifacom, in Paris, France.
I am passionate about Ruby, Rails, Meteor.js, computer internals, programming languages internals, and I see design pattern everywhere.
I love Design Pattern studies, it is this like running on this never ending road, full of discoveries and cool pubs. I like pubs, too.

And on gith... well, that is a non sense.
